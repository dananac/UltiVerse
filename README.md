# UltiVerse - CS 420
## By Dana Conley and Jordan Rood

A new Flutter project implementing the UltiVerse prototype which can be used across all platforms.

### Abstract
Our project idea is to design and build a web application that mitigates the difficulties for individuals when it comes to tournament planning (specifically for Ultimate frisbee).  This web application is planned to be a great tool for tournament planning as to make a “one-stop-shop” application where all the resources and steps to plan a full scale ultimate frisbee tournament would be at one’s fingertips. This application would be essentially a road map into how to plan, host, and manage an ultimate frisbee tournament with all the steps integrated into it for an interactive, easy to use process of completing all the details needed to properly advertise and set up a sports tournament. Finally, this application could be widely expanded upon with various features such as making it into a team social network where users can post media and interact with one another or an advertising tool for finding pick-up games, etc.  Other sports could also utilize this tool in bringing all sports communities together in an all around easier more enjoyable way.
